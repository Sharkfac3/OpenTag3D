## For people who print

### Why does filament need an RFID tag?

An RFID tag gives every spool a digital identity. It carries the filament's
material, color, recommended settings, and other useful details. Compatible
printers and slicers can read that information automatically, so you spend less
time adjusting profiles, catch incompatible settings before a print starts,
and keep your filament organized.

<div class="benefit-card" markdown="1">

#### Save Time

Your spool can provide its configuration and profiles for you. Change materials
or colors without manually changing your print settings.

</div>

<div class="benefit-card" markdown="1">

#### Make Less Mistakes

Your printer can warn you when your settings fall outside the filament's
specifications, helping catch errors that could cause a print to fail before it
starts.

</div>

<div class="benefit-card" markdown="1">

#### Be More Organized

Every tag identifies its spool, including details such as color, material, and
serial number. Use that information for inventory and organization that ties
directly into your printers.

</div>

</div>

### What can it enable?

OpenTag3D is a standard, not a single app or product. It gives projects a common
set of data they can use to build features such as:

- **Automatic slicer profiles:** Load settings from the filament instead of
  finding and entering them by hand.
- **Inventory management:** Identify each spool uniquely and keep its material,
  color, and other details together.
- **Automatic dryer settings:** Select an appropriate temperature and duration
  for the material, reducing the risk of a drying mistake.
- **Filament-remaining estimates:** Use the tag as a rotation marker and combine
  it with the stored core diameter, or weigh the spool and subtract the stored
  empty-spool weight.

> [!NOTE]
> These are capabilities the standard makes possible. Availability depends on
> the printer, slicer, accessory, or community project you use.

### I’m sold. How do I start?

#### 1. Use filament and projects that already support OpenTag3D

This is the easiest route: buy a tagged spool, then use it with a compatible printer, accessory, slicer, or community project.

For more details on the filament brands, projects, and companies that support the standard, see the current [supporters and implementation status](/about#supporters).

#### 2. Write your own tags

Buy compatible NFC tags, enter the spool information in
[Make a Tag](/make), and write the result using one of the methods below. The
specification is designed around **NTAG215** tags; **NTAG216** tags are also
supported.

If the filament manufacturer offers an online OpenTag3D export, use it to fill
in the product data automatically. Otherwise, you can enter the information
yourself.

<img class="getting-started__overview-image getting-started__overview-image--compact" src="/assets/images/nfc-reader-options.png" alt="Examples of NFC and RFID readers that can work with filament tags">

##### With a phone (recommended)

On Android, open the [Make a Tag](/make) webpage in a [Web NFC-compatible browser](https://caniuse.com/webnfc). You can create, read, and write a tag directly from the page.

On iPhone, OpenTag3D data can be read and written via third-party native apps. We recommend [NFC Tools](https://www.wakdev.com) or [SpoolSense](https://spoolsense.org/) as they has the best coverage of the spec fields.

Other mobile applications are available for reading and writing OpenTag3D data. Here is a list:

Building an app? [Let us know](/about#contact) so it can be added here.

##### With a computer (advanced)

- **NFC Tools Desktop:** Use a USB NFC reader such as the ACR122U (typically
  around $30) to read and write tags. Follow Polar Filament’s
  [OpenTag3D NFC Tools guide](https://pfil.us/opentag3d.php).
- **Proxmark3:** Use this popular RFID development toolkit with the Proxmark3
  export provided by [Make a Tag](/make).

##### With a Flipper Zero

Go to the [Make a Tag](/make) webpage to generate the data, and then export the Flipper Zero .nfc file. Then, load the file onto your Flipper, either using qFlipper or directly to the SD card. You can then emulate or write the NFC data via the NFC app, just like any other NFC tag.

## For developers

OpenTag3D is openly documented and its source is available on GitHub. Start with
the specification, then use the existing source and community projects as
implementation references.

<div class="getting-started__actions">
  <a class="btn btn--primary" href="/spec">Read the specification</a>
  <a class="btn" href="https://github.com/GooborgStudios/OpenTag3D">View the source on GitHub</a>
</div>

The [reader implementation guidelines](/spec#reader-implementation-guidelines)
cover the details most hardware and firmware integrations need first.

## For manufacturers

OpenTag3D is free to adopt. There are **no licensing fees, required vendors, or
certification requirements**. You can source tags and readers entirely on your
own, manufacture your own solution, and implement as much of the open standard
as your product needs.

There is no central service that your product must depend on. The essential
filament data lives on the tag and works offline; optional web lookups can be
hosted by the manufacturer or another provider. OpenTag3D is both open source
and decentralized.

Please feel free to [contact the project maintainers](/about#contact) to discuss implementation. We can walk through the getting-started documentation, answer integration questions, and help you avoid common hardware and data-format pitfalls.
